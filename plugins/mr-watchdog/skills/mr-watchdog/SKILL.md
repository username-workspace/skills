# mr-watchdog

You open the MR; this watches its CI land — in the background, and the result **comes back to you in the
conversation**. The trigger is the **merge request**, not a command.

The watcher runs as a **background task your session owns**: it is launched with `run_in_background`,
the **harness tracks it across turns**, and when it exits the harness **re-invokes your session** with
the result. There is no detached daemon, no status file, no polling-by-hook — the harness's own
background-task tracking is the delivery channel.

It is **read-only** — it never commits, pushes, or merges. On green it tells you `ok, all good`; on red
it hands back the failing job log so your session fixes the **root cause** (no bypass).

## How it fires

A **`Stop` hook** (`hooks/stop-hook.py` → `watch.py hook`) checks, at end-of-turn, whether the current
branch has an **open MR with live CI** that this session pushed and hasn't watched yet for this HEAD. If
so it emits a **`block`** asking your session to launch the watcher in the background:

```bash
python3 scripts/watch.py run --repo <repo>   # launch with run_in_background=true, then carry on
```

You launch it once (the nudge is dedup'd per pipeline HEAD). **Two engagement modes:** by default
(explicit), only the handoff stamp ship-when-done writes when **it** pushes engages the watcher — fully
deterministic. With `HARNESS_AUTO_ENGAGE=1` in the environment, engagement is also inferred: a companion
`UserPromptSubmit` hook stamps the branch's pushed state at the start of each turn, and a branch **this
session actually pushed** (its `@{u}` advanced) is engaged too (auto is scoped: never for a session
launched outside a git repo, never under a path of `HARNESS_AUTO_ENGAGE_EXCLUDE`). Either way a stale MR or someone else's
MR is never touched. Opt a repo **out** with `{ "enabled": false }` in `.mr-watchdog.json`.

## The watcher (`run`) — poll until resolved, then exit

`run` is a foreground poll loop **meant to be launched with run_in_background**. It polls the CI and
**exits the moment the pipeline resolves**, printing the verdict — and the harness re-invokes your
session with that output:

| CI status | What `run` does |
|---|---|
| `pending` | wait `poll_interval`, poll again |
| `success` | print `ok, all good — CI green on '<branch>'`, **exit 0** |
| `failed`  | print the failing job log + the fix directive, **exit 1** |
| MR closed / HEAD moved | print why, exit (a fresh watcher starts after the next push) |

When your session is re-invoked: **green** → tell the user `ok, all good`; **red** → fix the ROOT cause
from the log (no bypass), run `verify`, push the fix. The push re-triggers the chain, and a fresh
watcher is launched for the new HEAD.

`on_red: "notify"` makes `run` print the red log as a passive report instead of a fix directive.

## `verify` — the fake-green gate, in your hands

Run it before committing a CI fix. It scans your working-tree change and **fails (exit 1)** if the
"fix" hides the failure instead of resolving it — a **deleted** or **weakened** test (an edit that
drops an assertion), `assert True`, `--no-verify`, `|| true`, `continue-on-error`, `allow_failure`,
`when: never`, blanket `eslint-disable` / `# type: ignore` / `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error`,
`--maxfail`, etc. Clean change → exit 0.

```bash
python3 scripts/watch.py verify --repo .
```

## Guardrails

- **Read-only**: never commits, pushes, or merges — there is no git-write path in the watcher.
- **Only watches**: it polls CI and reads logs — the fix is done by your interactive session.
- **Never the default branch**, never a `wip/` branch, never a detached HEAD (it just won't watch).
- **Engagement**: only a branch this session pushed; the launch nudge fires **once per pipeline HEAD**.
- **Already green at the Stop**: nothing to watch — the verdict itself is handed to the session (once
  per HEAD, bound to the exact sha; a stale branch-level green is not a verdict).

## Enable & configure

No config is required. Drop a `.mr-watchdog.json` only to tune it or opt out:
```jsonc
{
  "enabled": true,         // set false to opt this repo OUT (either engagement mode)
  "on_red": "fix",         // fix (hand the failure to your session to fix) | notify (just report it)
  "forge": null,           // github | gitlab — auto-detected from the remote unless set
  "poll_interval": 30,     // seconds between CI polls
  "log_lines": 200,        // failing-log lines carried into the handoff
  "skip_marker": "wip/",
  "watch_timeout": 3600    // seconds before a still-pending watch gives up (the poll loop is always bounded)
}
```

## Manual / debug

```bash
python3 scripts/watch.py run    --repo .     # the bg watcher: poll until resolved, then exit (run_in_background)
python3 scripts/watch.py hook   --repo .     # what the Stop hook calls: emit the launch block if due
python3 scripts/watch.py tick   --repo .     # run ONE poll in the foreground (no loop)
python3 scripts/watch.py verify --repo .     # check the current working-tree fix for fake-green
```

Every exit of `run` leaves its verdict in `.git/mr-watchdog-verdict.json` (`green`, `red` with the
failing log, or `stopped` with the reason), bound to the sha it watched. Launched with `--need N` (by
delivery-conductor), it prints a neutral verdict line instead of the fix directive: the conductor turns
the evidence into the next instruction. `handoff --session S --branch B` is how ship-when-done engages the
watch for a branch its session pushed.

## Stage protocol (delivery-conductor)

`scripts/watch.py stage --repo R --need N --json` answers, read-only, where a need stands in its `ci` stage:
a v1 report with the stage's `state` (`done`, `pending`, `blocked`), its `evidence` (bound to the exact
work state or sha it was produced on) and the `next` step (`script`, `background` or `skill`). A repo that
opted this plugin out gets `{"enabled": false}` from it. See `docs/architecture.md` in the marketplace.


## Dependencies

`git`, Python 3 (stdlib only), and a forge CLI — **`gh`** (GitHub) or **`glab`** (GitLab) — to read CI
status and logs. The fix runs in your interactive session.

## Caveats

- It opens no MR and merges nothing — it's the CI-watch step after **ship-when-done** (which pushes and
  opens the MR once **merge-review** has passed) for the full open → review → green → (you merge) chain.
- The verdict belongs to the exact commit being watched, read from structured forge data — never a
  CLI's human output: on GitHub the commit's latest check runs; on GitLab, when the branch has an open
  MR, the MR's head pipeline (GitLab's own merge gate, whether branch, detached, merged-results or
  merge-train), once it belongs to the watched sha (a merged-results pipeline runs on a merge commit
  whose last parent, the MR source, is that sha); without an MR, the newest branch pipeline of that sha. Only `success` is
  green, `failed`/`canceled` red, anything else keeps polling. Pipelines of other refs sharing the sha
  (security policy, workloads) are never its verdict. On red, the log is the gating pipeline's failed
  job traces (allowed-to-fail jobs excluded). Nothing registered yet for the sha → `none`, and the
  watcher keeps polling rather than guessing.
- Delivery rides the harness: the watcher is a background task **your session launched**, so its verdict
  re-invokes that session when it resolves. The only remote dependency in the whole chain lives here.
