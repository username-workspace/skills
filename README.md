Open, horizontal, re-usable Claude Code skills & plugins by **Username** ([Studio A.I.](https://username.digital)).
Dependency-free (stdlib Python + bash + git), each one useful on its own. Company-specific (vertical)
skills live in a separate private repo.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add username-workspace/skills
/plugin install <plugin>@username
```

## The delivery harness

Four of these plugins compose into a delivery pipeline — each one useful alone, loosely coupled through
`.git` state when together:

**ship-when-done** commits at each milestone and opens the draft PR only when the work is provably
done (quality gate green) → **merge-review** holds every push until an adversarial review passes →
**mr-watchdog** watches the PR's CI in the background and brings the verdict back into the session
(`ok, all good — CI green`) → **proof-of-fix** enforces evidence-first bug fixing: a recorded probe
that fails before the fix and passes after it.

Two engagement modes: by default the pipeline is **explicit and fully deterministic** — it acts only
on declared signals (`mark-done`, ship's handoff stamp). Set `HARNESS_AUTO_ENGAGE=1` to let it
**infer engagement** from observed session work (turn-start baselines, edit provenance) and act on
its own.

## Plugins

<!-- plugins:begin -->
| Plugin | Version | Category | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`claude-remote-spawn`](./plugins/claude-remote-spawn) | 1.3.0 | Agents | Spawn a new Claude Code session remotely, on your own machine. |
| [`find-session`](./plugins/find-session) | 1.0.4 | Agents | Find and resume the past Claude Code session you're thinking of. |
| [`delivery-metrics`](./plugins/delivery-metrics) | 1.0.6 | Analytics | Turn git history into a developer productivity & quality dashboard. |
| [`aws-remote-auth`](./plugins/aws-remote-auth) | 1.0.3 | DevOps | Re-authenticate to AWS from anywhere, on demand, with an autofill device code. |
| [`mr-watchdog`](./plugins/mr-watchdog) | 3.0.0 | DevOps | Open a merge request, then forget it — a background watcher follows its CI and hands the verdict back to your session. |
| [`ship-when-done`](./plugins/ship-when-done) | 2.0.0 | DevOps | Commit at each milestone, push so nothing is lost, open the PR when it's actually done. |
| [`coding-agent-usage`](./plugins/coding-agent-usage) | 1.2.1 | FinOps | See your AI coding-agent usage — and where you rank against other developers. |
| [`merge-review`](./plugins/merge-review) | 2.0.0 | Quality | An adversarial reviewer that scores the diff, fixes what's attested, and loops until it's merge-ready. |
| [`proof-of-fix`](./plugins/proof-of-fix) | 1.0.4 | Quality | Prove the bug before fixing it — then prove the fix with the same probe. Red before, green after. |
| [`security-audit`](./plugins/security-audit) | 1.3.3 | Security | One Trivy scan, every ecosystem — a prioritised security report. |

## Quality

Every plugin ships a hermetic test suite — `bash scripts/run-tests.sh` runs them all (CI gate).
Real usage is validated separately: a generative E2E lane (`tests/e2e/`) replays full deliveries —
seeded scenarios, project archetypes, human-divergence twists — against a real sandbox forge, and
every proven situation is recorded (with the harness commit it was proven against) in
`tests/e2e/coverage.json`.

## Documentation

- **[docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md)** — how the marketplace is built: plugin anatomy,
  the vendored kernel, `.git`-local state and sibling coupling, the delivery harness, engagement modes,
  the test architecture, and the security model.
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** — the contributor workflow: the gate, the incident rule
  (evidence-first, symptom vs root cause), adding a plugin, versioning, and the self-hosted delivery.
- **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** — the binding engineering rules, loaded into an agent's context.
- Each plugin's **`SKILL.md`** documents its behaviour.
